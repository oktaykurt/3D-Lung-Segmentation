# 3D-lung-segmentation
Accurate 3D lung segmentation from CT images is critical for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary diseases. This project builds upon a 3D U-Net to tackle the AAPM Thoracic Auto- segmentation Challenge dataset. The primary objective is to reduce overfitting and enhance generalization.
